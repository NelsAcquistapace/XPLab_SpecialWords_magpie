Before taking part in this study, please read the consent form below.

Consent Form
This study involves a web-based experiment and is conducted by Cognitive Science students from the University of Osnabrück for the course "Experimental Psychology Lab". No deception is involved, and the study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life).

Participation in the study takes about 15 minutes and is strictly anonymous. All responses are treated confidentially, and in no case will responses from individual participants be identified. Rather, all data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. Participants should be aware, however, that the experiment is not being run from a "secure" https server of the kind typically used to handle credit card transactions, so there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by unauthorized third parties (e.g., computer hackers).

Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty, and participants may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.
If participants have further questions about this study or their rights, or if they wish to lodge a complaint or concern, they may contact kdunkel@uos.de.

If you are 18 years of age or older, understand the statements above, and freely consent to participate in the study, you may now begin the experiment.
