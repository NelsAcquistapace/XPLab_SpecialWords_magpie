# What makes words special?
# The Facilitating Role of Language

This directory contains the recreated experiment from Edminston and Lupyan (2015), experiment 1a from the paper:
Edmiston, P., & Lupyan, G. (2015). What makes words special? Words as unmotivated cues. Cognition, 143, 93-100.


## Materials

The experiment uses in total 24 audio tracks (12 spoken labels and 12 environmental sounds) and 24 pictures of the categories <em>bird, dog, drum, guitar, motorcycle</em> and <em>phone</em>.

Participants first hear an audio track and then see a picture. By forced binary choice, participants have to decide whether the sound and image represent the same basic-level category.
